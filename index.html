        <p> Hermione Granger is truely an inspiring character from the Hary Potter series from day one. Here are the top some reasons why Hermione Granger is more than just a side character. To begin with, Hermione on countless occations has saved the lives of both Harry and Ron. If it wasn't for her, they probably would be dead before the first movie or book concluded. Also, she is not only brave but is very witty, clever, and kind. She is a great rolemodle for many and continues to inspire many young girls and boys (myself included). She is loyal to her friends and (spoiler alert) even sacrificed her family for their saftey! She put a memory charm on them to protect them. Her parents are both muggles, or non-magical people. She knows how to protect herself and is prepared for any situation, (Refrence from the wedding scene - last movie part 1). To conclude, Hermione Granger is an incrredible personality. While she may be part of a fantasy, she still has taught us some important lessons.
